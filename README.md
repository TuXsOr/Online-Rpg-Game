# Online Rpg Game
This project is an online simplistic semi-text based rpg.
#
#### Project Background
This repo is my attempt at learning C# and networking.
With a very basic understanding of C# I'm aware that this is a terrible idea but I'm determined to learn while developing.

I aim to update this more as the project is developed.

### Server Configuration
The server when ran will create a default ServerConfig.json file in the root directory of the server application.
The server will bind the TCP listener and port to the ones in the config file. You can also change the path of where saved data is written, along with the buffer size for network handling.
